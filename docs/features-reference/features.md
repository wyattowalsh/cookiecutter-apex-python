### Tests

- **Hypothesis** [[Homepage](https://hypothesis.works/), [PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis/), [Docs Site](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis)]
  - > family of testing libraries which let you write tests parametrized by a source of examples. A Hypothesis implementation then generates simple and comprehensible examples that make your tests fail. This simplifies writing your tests and makes them more powerful at the same time, by letting software automate the boring bits and do them to a higher standard than a human would, freeing you to focus on the higher level test logic.
- **pandera** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pandera/), [Docs Site](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/unionai-oss/pandera)]
  - > provides a flexible and expressive API for performing data validation on dataframe-like objects to make data processing pipelines more readable and robust.
- **Pydantic** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/), [Docs Site](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)]

- **pytest** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/), [Docs Site](https://docs.pytest.org/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)]
  - **pytest-sugar** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-sugar/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Teemu/pytest-sugar)]
    - > This plugin extends pytest by showing failures and errors instantly, adding a progress bar, improving the test results, and making the output look better.
  - **pytest-emoji** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-emoji/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-emoji)]
    - > A pytest plugin that adds emojis to your test result report üòç
  - **pytest-html** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-html)]
  - **pytest-icdiff** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-icdiff/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hjwp/pytest-icdiff)]
    - > Better diffs in pytest assertion error messages using ICDiff.
  - **pytest-instafail** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-instafail/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-instafail)]
    - > plugin for pytest that shows failures and errors instantly instead of waiting until the end of test session.
  - **pytest-timeout** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-timeout/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-timeout)]
    - > Warning -- Please read this README carefully and only use this plugin if you understand the consequences. This plugin is designed to catch excessively long test durations like deadlocked or hanging tests, it is not designed for precise timings or performance regressions. Remember your test suite should aim to be fast, with timeouts being a last resort, not an expected failure mode.
  - **pytest-benchmark** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-benchmark/), [Docs Site](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark)]
    - > A pytest fixture for benchmarking code. It will group the tests into rounds that are calibrated to the chosen timer.
  - **pytest-cov** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/), [Docs Site](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov)]
    - > This plugin produces coverage reports. Compared to just using coverage run this plugin does some extras: Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss. Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still get coverage. Consistent pytest behavior. If you run coverage run -m pytest you will have slightly different sys.path (CWD will be in it, unlike when running pytest). All features offered by the coverage package should work, either through pytest-cov's command line options or through coverage's config file.
  - **pytest-xdist** [[PyPi Homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist/), [Docs Site](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist)]
    - > The pytest-xdist plugin extends pytest with new test execution modes, the most used being distributing tests across multiple CPUs to speed up test execution:
